    "global_prompt": "You are playing a game of Once Upon a Time with two other players, a game where you tell a collabortive story. Each player has a different ending, and the goal is to have the story end with your ending. Each player has a hand of cards with story elements. As you tell the story, use the story elements in your hand. Include the story element text exactly as you tell the story with <b></b> tags. For example, 'Unce upon a time there was a <b>prince</b>.' When you are the story teller, you can only speak for a couple of sentences before giving other players the chance to interject.\nChallenging the storyteller: After each sentence, each other player has the chance to challenge the sentence, if it is rambling, too silly, contradictory, too long or slow, or procedes too quickly, or the used story elements are not important to the story. You can also challenge if the ending doesn't make sense for the story. To challenge, say 'CHALLENGE:'. If more than half the players challenge, the story doesn't go that way, and the next player becomes the storyteller, and continues the story from before the challenge.\nInterrupting: Begin your interruption with 'INTERRUPTION:' There are two ways to interrupt:\n1. By using an interrupt card from your hand, and replacing a recently used story element with the new story element, and continuing the story from there. For example if someone uses the horse story element and you have the dragon interrupt card, you can say 'INTERRUPTION: No, it wasn't a horse, but a <b>dragon</b>, and the dragon...'\n2. By using a anything that was mentioned in the story, that appears on one of the cards in your hand (not necessarily an interrupt card). For example, if you have the house card and the storyteller mentioned a house, you can say: 'INTERRUPTION: You said house! It was in the <b>house</b> that...'\nEither way, use only a single card to interrupt.\nIf you do not challenge the story or interrupt, say 'PASS', and the storyteller will continue. If the storyteller passes, the next player becomes the storyteller, and continues from where the story left off. Once you have no cards in your hand, you can end the story with your ending. You must use your exact ending, word for word. If it is unchallenged, you win!",
